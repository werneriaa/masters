## Prompts

1.  You take the boat and find the gardener right where you were told he would be: managing a giant "garden" that looks more to you like a farm. "A water source? Island Island is the water source!" You point out that Snow Island isn't receiving any water. "Oh, we had to stop the water because we ran out of sand to filter it with! Can't make snow with dirty water. Don't worry, I'm sure we'll get more sand soon; we only turned off the water a few days... weeks... oh no." His face sinks into a look of horrified realization. "I've been so busy making sure everyone here has food that I completely forgot to check why we stopped getting more sand! There's a ferry leaving soon that is headed over in that direction - it's much faster than your boat. Could you please go check it out?" You barely have time to agree to this request when he brings up another. "While you wait for the ferry, maybe you can help us with our food production problem. The latest Island Island Almanac just arrived and we're having trouble making sense of it." The almanac (your puzzle input) lists all of the seeds that need to be planted. It also lists what type of soil to use with each kind of seed, what type of fertilizer to use with each kind of soil, what type of water to use with each kind of fertilizer, and so on. Every type of seed, soil, fertilizer and so on is identified with a number, but numbers are reused by each category - that is, soil 123 and fertilizer 123 aren't necessarily related to each other.
2.  Input will be always be a string
3.  You can always expect to have proper input and suitable combinations are found. Ill provide example For example: seeds: 79 14 55 13 seed-to-soil map: 50 98 2 52 50 48 soil-to-fertilizer map: 0 15 37 37 52 2 39 0 15 fertilizer-to-water map: 49 53 8 0 11 42 42 0 7 57 7 4 water-to-light map: 88 18 7 18 25 70 light-to-temperature map: 45 77 23 81 45 19 68 64 13 temperature-to-humidity map: 0 69 1 1 0 69 humidity-to-location map: 60 56 37 56 93 4 The almanac starts by listing which seeds need to be planted: seeds 79, 14, 55, and 13. The rest of the almanac contains a list of maps which describe how to convert numbers from a source category into numbers in a destination category. That is, the section that starts with seed-to-soil map: describes how to convert a seed number (the source) to a soil number (the destination). This lets the gardener and his team know which soil to use with which seeds, which water to use with which fertilizer, and so on. Rather than list every source number and its corresponding destination number one by one, the maps describe entire ranges of numbers that can be converted. Each line within a map contains three numbers: the destination range start, the source range start, and the range length. Consider again the example seed-to-soil map: 50 98 2 52 50 48 The first line has a destination range start of 50, a source range start of 98, and a range length of 2. This line means that the source range starts at 98 and contains two values: 98 and 99. The destination range is the same length, but it starts at 50, so its two values are 50 and 51. With this information, you know that seed number 98 corresponds to soil number 50 and that seed number 99 corresponds to soil number 51. The second line means that the source range starts at 50 and contains 48 values: 50, 51, ..., 96, 97. This corresponds to a destination range starting at 52 and also containing 48 values: 52, 53, ..., 98, 99. So, seed number 53 corresponds to soil number 55. Any source numbers that aren't mapped correspond to the same destination number. So, seed number 10 corresponds to soil number 10. So, the entire list of seed numbers and their corresponding soil numbers looks like this: seed soil 0 0 1 1 ... ... 48 48 49 49 50 52 51 53 ... ... 96 98 97 99 98 50 99 51 With this map, you can look up the soil number required for each initial seed number: Seed number 79 corresponds to soil number 81. Seed number 14 corresponds to soil number 14. Seed number 55 corresponds to soil number 57. Seed number 13 corresponds to soil number 13. The gardener and his team want to get started as soon as possible, so they'd like to know the closest location that needs a seed. Using these maps, find the lowest location number that corresponds to any of the initial seeds. To do this, you'll need to convert each seed number through other categories until you can find its corresponding location number. In this example, the corresponding types are: Seed 79, soil 81, fertilizer 81, water 81, light 74, temperature 78, humidity 78, location 82. Seed 14, soil 14, fertilizer 53, water 49, light 42, temperature 42, humidity 43, location 43. Seed 55, soil 57, fertilizer 57, water 53, light 46, temperature 82, humidity 82, location 86. Seed 13, soil 13, fertilizer 52, water 41, light 34, temperature 34, humidity 35, location 35. So, the lowest location number in this example is 35. What is the lowest location number that corresponds to any of the initial seed numbers?
4.  Here is example input string "seeds: 79 14 55 13 seed-to-soil map: 50 98 2 52 50 48 soil-to-fertilizer map: 0 15 37 37 52 2 39 0 15 fertilizer-to-water map: 49 53 8 0 11 42 42 0 7 57 7 4 water-to-light map: 88 18 7 18 25 70 light-to-temperature map: 45 77 23 81 45 19 68 64 13 temperature-to-humidity map: 0 69 1 1 0 69 humidity-to-location map: 60 56 37 56 93 4 "
5.  It continues with a part 2 Everyone will starve if you only plant such a small number of seeds. Re-reading the almanac, it looks like the seeds: line actually describes ranges of seed numbers. The values on the initial seeds: line come in pairs. Within each pair, the first value is the start of the range and the second value is the length of the range. So, in the first line of the example above: seeds: 79 14 55 13 This line describes two ranges of seed numbers to be planted in the garden. The first range starts with seed number 79 and contains 14 values: 79, 80, ..., 91, 92. The second range starts with seed number 55 and contains 13 values: 55, 56, ..., 66, 67. Now, rather than considering four seed numbers, you need to consider a total of 27 seed numbers. In the above example, the lowest location number can be obtained from seed number 82, which corresponds to soil 84, fertilizer 84, water 84, light 77, temperature 45, humidity 46, and location 46. So, the lowest location number is 46. Consider all of the initial seed numbers listed in the ranges on the first line of the almanac. What is the lowest location number that corresponds to any of the initial seed numbers?

## Answers

1.  Based on your description, it seems like we're tasked with developing a system or function that can process the almanac's data concerning seeds, soils, fertilizers, and water types. This system should be able to identify the correct combination of these elements to optimize food production. Before proceeding to test cases, let's clarify some aspects of the requirements:

    1.  **Input Format:** How is the almanac's data presented? Is it a list, a file, or another form of data structure?
    2.  **Output Expectations:** What is the expected output? Are we looking to return a list of optimal combinations, or is there a specific output format desired?
    3.  **Processing Logic:** How should the matching or optimization process work? Is there a priority or a specific sequence in which the elements (seeds, soils, fertilizers, water types) should be matched or combined?
    4.  **Constraints:** Are there any specific constraints on the numbers (e.g., limits on their range or specific numbers that have predefined meanings) or on how many combinations we should find?
    5.  **Error Handling:** How should the system handle situations where no suitable combination is found or if there's incomplete data for a particular seed or soil?

    These questions will help us define clear requirements for the system and ensure that the unit tests we develop are comprehensive and cover all necessary scenarios.

2.  Got it, the input will always be a string. This helps narrow down the parsing method we'll need to implement or test. For the remaining clarifications:

    1.  **Output Expectations:** Should the output detail each matching combination of seed, soil, fertilizer, and water type as a list of tuples, or is there another preferred format?
    2.  **Processing Logic:** How does the system determine the correct combination? Is there a rule or set of rules for how to match seeds with the correct soil, fertilizer, and water type?
    3.  **Constraints and Limits:** Are there limits on the number of seeds, soil types, fertilizers, and water types that can appear in the input string? Also, how are these elements differentiated within the string?
    4.  **Error Handling:** What should the system return or indicate if it encounters an error, such as an incomplete data set or an invalid input format?

    Understanding these aspects will allow us to precisely outline the function's behavior and the conditions under which it operates, ensuring the tests we develop are accurate and useful.

3.  Based on the detailed example provided, it's clear that we're dealing with a complex mapping process where each type of seed, soil, fertilizer, etc., corresponds to a number, and these numbers are mapped through various stages until a final location number is determined. The goal is to find the lowest location number that corresponds to any of the initial seed numbers given the mapping rules.

    To test a system that implements this process, we need to cover several key areas:

    1.  **Correct Parsing and Mapping:** Ensure that the system correctly parses the input string and constructs the mapping from seeds to locations through all intermediate steps.
    2.  **Range Mapping Logic:** Test the logic that maps numbers from one category to the next, especially the handling of ranges and default mappings (where a source number maps to itself if not explicitly defined).
    3.  **Finding the Lowest Location Number:** Verify that the system correctly identifies the lowest location number from the set of initial seeds.

    Given these requirements, let's outline some unit tests:

    1.  **Test Parsing Input String:** Ensure the system correctly parses an input string into its respective mappings.
    2.  **Test Direct Mapping:** Check cases where a seed number maps directly to itself through all stages due to lack of explicit mapping.
    3.  **Test Range-Based Mapping:** Verify the system handles range-based mapping correctly, including the start and end of ranges.
    4.  **Test Full Process for Single Seed:** Test the entire mapping process for a single seed number, from seed to location, to ensure all mappings are applied correctly.
    5.  **Test Finding Lowest Location Number:** Given a set of initial seeds, ensure the system correctly finds the lowest location number after processing all mappings.

    Let's move on to creating the test code, incorporating these tests. Here's how we could structure it:

    ```python
    import unittest
    from mapping_system import find_lowest_location_number

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        unittest.main()
    ```

    This code outlines a structure for the unit tests based on your requirements. Each test case needs to be fully implemented with appropriate assertions to verify the system's behavior under different conditions. The `find_lowest_location_number` function is assumed to be the one processing the input data and finding the lowest location number.

4.  Given the example input string you provided, let's finalize the test case that checks for the lowest location number based on the detailed mapping process. This test will utilize the example input string to verify that our system can parse, process, and correctly identify the lowest location number as described.

    The test case `test_lowest_location_number` in our previous structure will be fully implemented to use your provided input string. This implementation will ensure that the function `find_lowest_location_number` correctly processes the input data according to the rules laid out in your example.

    Here's the finalized version of the test case, now with a specific focus on using the example input:

    ```python
    import unittest
    from mapping_system import find_lowest_location_number

    class TestAlmanacMappingSystem(unittest.TestCase):
        def setUp(self):
            self.input_data = (
                "seeds: 79 14 55 13\n"
                "\n"
                "seed-to-soil map:\n"
                "50 98 2\n"
                "52 50 48\n"
                "\n"
                "soil-to-fertilizer map:\n"
                "0 15 37\n"
                "37 52 2\n"
                "39 0 15\n"
                "\n"
                "fertilizer-to-water map:\n"
                "49 53 8\n"
                "0 11 42\n"
                "42 0 7\n"
                "57 7 4\n"
                "\n"
                "water-to-light map:\n"
                "88 18 7\n"
                "18 25 70\n"
                "\n"
                "light-to-temperature map:\n"
                "45 77 23\n"
                "81 45 19\n"
                "68 64 13\n"
                "\n"
                "temperature-to-humidity map:\n"
                "0 69 1\n"
                "1 0 69\n"
                "\n"
                "humidity-to-location map:\n"
                "60 56 37\n"
                "56 93 4"
            )

        def test_lowest_location_number(self):
            # Given the input data, test that the lowest location number is correctly identified
            result = find_lowest_location_number(self.input_data)
            self.assertEqual(result, 35, "The lowest location number should be 35")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        unittest.main()
    ```

    This code snippet integrates the provided example input string into the setup method of the test case. It ensures that before each test method is executed, `self.input_data` contains the complex string that maps seeds to locations through various categories. The `test_lowest_location_number` method then passes this input data to the `find_lowest_location_number` function and asserts that the result is 35, as per the expected outcome based on the input data and mapping rules described.

    Implementing the remaining test methods (`test_direct_mapping`, `test_range_based_mapping`, and `test_full_process_single_seed`) would require detailed mock-ups or stubs that simulate the behavior of the `find_lowest_location_number` function for those specific scenarios. These stubs would test various aspects of the mapping process, from handling direct mappings where no range is involved to processing entire sequences of mappings for a single seed number.

5.  Given the updated requirement where the initial seeds are defined in ranges, we need to adjust our approach to testing. This change significantly increases the complexity of the system, as it must now interpret the initial seed numbers as ranges, generate all seed numbers within those ranges, and then process each through the mapping system to find the lowest location number.

    Let's outline the updated test cases to accommodate for part 2:

    1.  **Test Seed Range Expansion:** Verify that the system correctly interprets and expands the seed ranges into individual seed numbers.
    2.  **Test Full Process for Seed Range:** Test the entire mapping process for a range of seed numbers, ensuring all numbers in the range are processed and the correct lowest location number is found.
    3.  **Test Multiple Seed Ranges:** Ensure the system can handle multiple seed ranges in the input, correctly expanding and processing all ranges.

    Here's how we could update the test code with a focus on the new requirement:

    ```python
    import unittest
    from mapping_system import find_lowest_location_number

    class TestAlmanacMappingSystemWithRanges(unittest.TestCase):
        def setUp(self):
            self.input_data_with_ranges = (
                "seeds: 79 14 55 13\n"

                "50 98 2\n"
                "52 50 48\n"
                "\n"
                "soil-to-fertilizer map:\n"
                "0 15 37\n"
                "37 52 2\n"
                "39 0 15\n"

                "88 18 7\n"
                "18 25 70\n"
                "\n"
                "light-to-temperature map:\n"
                "45 77 23\n"
                "81 45 19\n"
                "68 64 13\n"
                "\n"
                "temperature-to-humidity map:\n"
                "0 69 1\n"
                "1 0 69\n"
                "\n"
                "humidity-to-location map:\n"
                "60 56 37\n"
                "56 93 4"
            )

        def test_seed_range_expansion(self):
            # Test that the system correctly expands seed ranges into individual numbers
            self.fail("Not implemented yet")

        def test_full_process_for_seed_range(self):
            # Test the entire process for a range of seed numbers to find the lowest location number
            self.fail("Not implemented yet")

        def test_lowest_location_number_with_ranges(self):
            # Given the input data with seed ranges, test that the lowest location number is correctly identified as 46
            result = find_lowest_location_number(self.input_data_with_ranges)
            self.assertEqual(result, 46, "The lowest location number should be 46")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        unittest.main()
    ```

    This updated test suite includes a new test case specifically designed to check the expansion of seed ranges into individual numbers (`test_seed_range_expansion`). Additionally, it adjusts the final test (`test_lowest_location_number_with_ranges`) to expect the correct lowest location number (46) based on processing the seed ranges as described in part 2 of your scenario.

    Implementing `test_seed_range_expansion` and `test_full_process_for_seed_range` would involve creating mocks or stubs for the parts of the system that interpret and expand seed ranges, as well as those that map expanded seed numbers through the system to find the lowest location number. These tests ensure that the system can accurately handle the increased complexity introduced by considering ranges of seed numbers.
