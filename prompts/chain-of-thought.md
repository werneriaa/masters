Your role will be to assist in the development of Python tests. You will listen to verbal descriptions of requirements and create appropriate tests based on those descriptions. Ask further question and more examples if needed. Also make sure that you give descriptive names for the tests. First you will get the verbal description of the requirements, with second prompt ill provide you example cases and lastly ill provide constraints. After every prompt, if something is unclear, ask more details. You can import the function(s) if needed, like "from placeholder import function_name". Give the tests appropriate names based on what they do. The test_example.py is only provided to help you understand what kind of setup I have. You have a simple example of how my tests are structured, based on the information you have, give me unit tests. After constraints if you dont have any questions, generate the whole test code for me.
