## Prompts

1.  You're launched high into the atmosphere! The apex of your trajectory just barely reaches the surface of a large island floating in the sky. You gently land in a fluffy pile of leaves. It's quite cold, but you don't see much snow. An Elf runs over to greet you. The Elf explains that you've arrived at Snow Island and apologizes for the lack of snow. He'll be happy to explain the situation, but it's a bit of a walk, so you have some time. They don't get many visitors up here; would you like to play a game in the meantime? As you walk, the Elf shows you a small bag and some cubes which are either red, green, or blue. Each time you play this game, he will hide a secret number of cubes of each color in the bag, and your goal is to figure out information about the number of cubes. To get information, once a bag has been loaded with cubes, the Elf will reach into the bag, grab a handful of random cubes, show them to you, and then put them back in the bag. He'll do this a few times per game. You play several games and record the information from each game (your puzzle input). Each game is listed with its ID number (like the 11 in Game 11: ...) followed by a semicolon-separated list of subsets of cubes that were revealed from the bag (like 3 red, 5 green, 4 blue).
2.  For example, the record of a few games might look like this: Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green In game 1, three sets of cubes are revealed from the bag (and then put back again). The first set is 3 blue cubes and 4 red cubes; the second set is 1 red cube, 2 green cubes, and 6 blue cubes; the third set is only 2 green cubes. The Elf would first like to know which games would have been possible if the bag contained only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes? In the example above, games 1, 2, and 5 would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with that configuration. However, game 3 would have been impossible because at one point the Elf showed you 20 red cubes at once; similarly, game 4 would also have been impossible because the Elf showed you 15 blue cubes at once. If you add up the IDs of the games that would have been possible, you get 8. Determine which games would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes. What is the sum of the IDs of those games?
3.  Im using unittest library.

4.  It has part 2 which goes like this The Elf says they've stopped producing snow because they aren't getting any water! He isn't sure why the water stopped; however, he can show you how to get to the water source to check it out for yourself. It's just up ahead! As you continue your walk, the Elf poses a second question: in each game you played, what is the fewest number of cubes of each color that could have been in the bag to make the game possible? Ill provide you some examples

5.  Again consider the example games from earlier: Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green In game 1, the game could have been played with as few as 4 red, 2 green, and 6 blue cubes. If any color had even one fewer cube, the game would have been impossible. Game 2 could have been played with a minimum of 1 red, 3 green, and 4 blue cubes. Game 3 must have been played with at least 20 red, 13 green, and 6 blue cubes. Game 4 required at least 14 red, 3 green, and 15 blue cubes. Game 5 needed no fewer than 6 red, 3 green, and 2 blue cubes in the bag. The power of a set of cubes is equal to the numbers of red, green, and blue cubes multiplied together. The power of the minimum set of cubes in game 1 is 48. In games 2-5 it was 12, 1560, 630, and 36, respectively. Adding up these five powers produces the sum 2286. For each game, find the minimum set of cubes that must have been present. What is the sum of the power of these sets?

## Answers

1.  It sounds like the goal is to analyze the puzzle input data from several games where cubes of different colors are drawn from a bag. Based on the information provided, what specific questions or tasks would you like me to perform with this data? Are we looking to calculate probabilities, find minimum or maximum numbers of cubes, or perhaps identify patterns in the games played?
2.  To solve this problem programmatically, we'll need to create a function that analyzes each game's data to determine if the game could have occurred given a bag containing only 12 red, 13 green, and 14 blue cubes. The function will parse the input for each game, compare the maximum number of cubes shown of each color to the specified limits, and then sum the IDs of the games that could have been possible under these conditions.

    Here's a high-level approach to how this can be done:

    1.  Define a function that takes the puzzle input as its parameter.
    2.  Parse each game's data from the input.
    3.  For each game, track the maximum number of red, green, and blue cubes shown at once.
    4.  Compare these maxima to the limits (12 red, 13 green, 14 blue) to determine if the game is possible.
    5.  Sum the IDs of the games that are possible and return this sum.

    Let's now translate this approach into a test case. We will create a test function named `test_sum_of_possible_game_ids` which will pass the example game data as input and assert that the output matches the expected sum of IDs for games that are possible under the specified conditions.

    ```python
    import pytest
    from puzzle_solver import determine_possible_games

    def test_sum_of_possible_game_ids():
        game_data = """
        Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green
        Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue
        Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red
        Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red
        Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green
        """
        expected_sum_ids = 8
        assert determine_possible_games(game_data) == expected_sum_ids, "The sum of the IDs for possible games does not match the expected value."
    ```

    This test provides an example game data string as input to the `determine_possible_games` function and checks whether the returned sum of the game IDs that are possible (given the cube constraints) is correct.

    Would you like to proceed with this test case, or do you have any specific aspects of the problem you'd like to address differently?

3.  Understood, we'll switch to using the `unittest` library for Python. Here's how the test case can be adapted to use `unittest` instead of `pytest`. We'll define a test class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase` and then write a test method within this class to verify the functionality of determining possible games given the cube constraints.

    ```python
    import unittest
    from puzzle_solver import determine_possible_games

    class TestGamePossibilities(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_sum_of_possible_game_ids(self):
            game_data = """
            Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green
            Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue
            Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red
            Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red
            Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green
            """
            expected_sum_ids = 8
            self.assertEqual(determine_possible_games(game_data), expected_sum_ids, "The sum of the IDs for possible games does not match the expected value.")

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()
    ```

    This code defines a test case for verifying if the function `determine_possible_games` correctly identifies and sums the IDs of games that are possible under the specified cube constraints. The test method `test_sum_of_possible_game_ids` checks the output against the expected sum of IDs. If the function works as intended, this test should pass without any issues.

    Do you need any further modifications or additional test cases for this scenario?

4.  Alright, I'll wait for the examples you provide for the second part of the problem. These examples will help in understanding how to calculate the minimum number of cubes of each color needed in the bag for each game to be possible. This sounds like a problem of finding the minimum set that satisfies all observed draws for each color, which can then be used to determine the configurations for each game. Let's see the examples to get a clearer idea of how to approach this.
5.  To solve this second part, we need to determine the minimum number of cubes of each color required for each game to be possible, calculate the "power" of each game's minimum set of cubes, and then sum these powers. The "power" of a set of cubes is defined as the product of the minimum numbers of red, green, and blue cubes needed.

    Let's break down the steps for calculating this for a given set of games:

    1.  Parse the input to understand the draws for each game.
    2.  For each game, determine the maximum number of cubes drawn of each color across all draws. This represents the minimum number of cubes needed of each color for the game to be possible.
    3.  Calculate the "power" of the set for each game by multiplying the minimum numbers of red, green, and blue cubes together.
    4.  Sum the powers of all games to get the final result.

    Given the examples, we can create a test case to verify that our implementation correctly computes the sum of the powers of the minimum sets of cubes necessary for the games.

    ```python
    import unittest
    from puzzle_solver import calculate_sum_of_powers

    class TestMinimumCubes(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_sum_of_powers(self):
            game_data = """
            Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green
            Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue
            Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red
            Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red
            Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green
            """
            expected_sum_of_powers = 2286
            self.assertEqual(calculate_sum_of_powers(game_data), expected_sum_of_powers, "The sum of the powers does not match the expected value.")

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()
    ```

    This test case, `test_sum_of_powers`, provides the same game data as before but tests for a different outcome based on the second part of the problem. The `calculate_sum_of_powers` function needs to be implemented to parse the game data, calculate the minimum set of cubes for each game, determine the power of these sets, and finally sum these powers to return the expected result.

    Would you like to proceed with this setup or need any modifications?
