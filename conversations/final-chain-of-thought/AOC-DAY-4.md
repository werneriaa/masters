## Prompts

1.  The gondola takes you up. Strangely, though, the ground doesn't seem to be coming with you; you're not climbing a mountain. As the circle of Snow Island recedes below you, an entire new landmass suddenly appears above you! The gondola carries you to the surface of the new island and lurches into the station. As you exit the gondola, the first thing you notice is that the air here is much warmer than it was on Snow Island. It's also quite humid. Is this where the water source is? The next thing you notice is an Elf sitting on the floor across the station in what seems to be a pile of colorful square cards. "Oh! Hello!" The Elf excitedly runs over to you. "How may I be of service?" You ask about water sources. "I'm not sure; I just operate the gondola lift. That does sound like something we'd have, though - this is Island Island, after all! I bet the gardener would know. He's on a different island, though - er, the small kind surrounded by water, not the floating kind. We really need to come up with a better naming scheme. Tell you what: if you can help me with something quick, I'll let you borrow my boat and you can go visit the gardener. I got all these scratchcards as a gift, but I can't figure out what I've won." The Elf leads you over to the pile of colorful cards. There, you discover dozens of scratchcards, all with their opaque covering already scratched off. Picking one up, it looks like each card has two lists of numbers separated by a vertical bar (|): a list of winning numbers and then a list of numbers you have. You organize the information into a table (your puzzle input). As far as the Elf has been able to figure out, you have to figure out which of the numbers you have appear in the list of winning numbers. The first match makes the card worth one point and each match after the first doubles the point value of that card.
2.  For example: Card 1: 41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86 6 31 17 9 48 53 Card 2: 13 32 20 16 61 | 61 30 68 82 17 32 24 19 Card 3: 1 21 53 59 44 | 69 82 63 72 16 21 14 1 Card 4: 41 92 73 84 69 | 59 84 76 51 58 5 54 83 Card 5: 87 83 26 28 32 | 88 30 70 12 93 22 82 36 Card 6: 31 18 13 56 72 | 74 77 10 23 35 67 36 11 In the above example, card 1 has five winning numbers (41, 48, 83, 86, and 17) and eight numbers you have (83, 86, 6, 31, 17, 9, 48, and 53). Of the numbers you have, four of them (48, 83, 17, and 86) are winning numbers! That means card 1 is worth 8 points (1 for the first match, then doubled three times for each of the three matches after the first). Card 2 has two winning numbers (32 and 61), so it is worth 2 points. Card 3 has two winning numbers (1 and 21), so it is worth 2 points. Card 4 has one winning number (84), so it is worth 1 point. Card 5 has no winning numbers, so it is worth no points. Card 6 has no winning numbers, so it is worth no points. So, in this example, the Elf's pile of scratchcards is worth 13 points.
3.  No. The example input is a string which contains "Card 1: 41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86 6 31 17 9 48 53" multiple rows
4.  There is no requirements, only example input
5.  The input str is like "Card 1: 41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86 6 31 17 9 48 53", it also has the text Card 1:
6.  It has a part 2 which goes like this. Ill give the example later Just as you're about to report your findings to the Elf, one of you realizes that the rules have actually been printed on the back of every card this whole time. There's no such thing as "points". Instead, scratchcards only cause you to win more scratchcards equal to the number of winning numbers you have. Specifically, you win copies of the scratchcards below the winning card equal to the number of matches. So, if card 10 were to have 5 matching numbers, you would win one copy each of cards 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. Copies of scratchcards are scored like normal scratchcards and have the same card number as the card they copied. So, if you win a copy of card 10 and it has 5 matching numbers, it would then win a copy of the same cards that the original card 10 won: cards 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. This process repeats until none of the copies cause you to win any more cards. (Cards will never make you copy a card past the end of the table.)
7.  This time, the above example goes differently: Card 1: 41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86 6 31 17 9 48 53 Card 2: 13 32 20 16 61 | 61 30 68 82 17 32 24 19 Card 3: 1 21 53 59 44 | 69 82 63 72 16 21 14 1 Card 4: 41 92 73 84 69 | 59 84 76 51 58 5 54 83 Card 5: 87 83 26 28 32 | 88 30 70 12 93 22 82 36 Card 6: 31 18 13 56 72 | 74 77 10 23 35 67 36 11 Card 1 has four matching numbers, so you win one copy each of the next four cards: cards 2, 3, 4, and 5. Your original card 2 has two matching numbers, so you win one copy each of cards 3 and 4. Your copy of card 2 also wins one copy each of cards 3 and 4. Your four instances of card 3 (one original and three copies) have two matching numbers, so you win four copies each of cards 4 and 5. Your eight instances of card 4 (one original and seven copies) have one matching number, so you win eight copies of card 5. Your fourteen instances of card 5 (one original and thirteen copies) have no matching numbers and win no more cards. Your one instance of card 6 (one original) has no matching numbers and wins no more cards. Once all of the originals and copies have been processed, you end up with 1 instance of card 1, 2 instances of card 2, 4 instances of card 3, 8 instances of card 4, 14 instances of card 5, and 1 instance of card 6. In total, this example pile of scratchcards causes you to ultimately have 30 scratchcards! Process all of the original and copied scratchcards until no more scratchcards are won. Including the original set of scratchcards, how many total scratchcards do you end up with?

## Answers

1.  Given the description, let's formulate the requirements for a Python function that computes the point value of a scratchcard based on the matching numbers with the winning numbers.

    The function should take two inputs:

    1.  A list of winning numbers.
    2.  A list of numbers the user has.

    The output should be the point value of the card, calculated based on the matching numbers between the two lists. The point system works as follows:

    - The first match is worth one point.
    - Each subsequent match doubles the point value (e.g., the second match makes the total 3 points, the third match 7 points, and so on).

    I will need some example cases to understand better how the matching and point doubling works in different scenarios. Could you provide those?

2.  Based on the example provided, I will now outline the tests we need to create to ensure our function correctly calculates the points for each scratchcard according to the rules specified. We'll write tests to cover various scenarios, including:

    1.  **test_card_with_multiple_matches**: To test a card that has multiple matching numbers with the winning numbers, similar to card 1 in the example. This card should correctly calculate the points when there are multiple matches, including the doubling effect.

    2.  **test_card_with_single_match**: To test a card that has only one matching number with the winning numbers, ensuring that the function correctly assigns a single point, similar to card 4 in the example.

    3.  **test_card_with_two_matches**: To test a card that has exactly two matching numbers with the winning numbers, to verify the point calculation is correct when there's more than one match but not multiple that would involve extensive doubling, like cards 2 and 3 in the example.

    4.  **test_card_with_no_matches**: To test a card that has no matching numbers with the winning numbers, ensuring that the function returns zero points, as seen with cards 5 and 6 in the example.

    5.  **test_card_with_all_matches**: To test a card where all numbers you have match the winning numbers, to ensure the function correctly calculates the points for the maximum possible matches.

    6.  **test_empty_card**: To test the function with an empty list of numbers you have and winning numbers, ensuring it handles empty input gracefully and returns zero points.

    Before proceeding to write the tests, do you have any specific constraints or additional details about the function implementation I should know?

3.  Understood, we'll need to adjust the function to parse the input from a multi-line string, where each line represents a scratchcard. Each line contains the winning numbers and the user's numbers, separated by a vertical bar (`|`). The function should then calculate the total point value of all scratchcards according to the rules specified.

    Here's what we'll do:

    1.  Parse the input string to separate each card's information into winning numbers and the user's numbers.
    2.  For each card, calculate the point value based on the matches.
    3.  Sum the point values of all cards to determine the total points.

    Given these requirements, I'll now need to understand the constraints, such as:

    - The format and type of the numbers (e.g., are they always integers?).
    - Limits on the number of cards or numbers on each card.
    - How to handle invalid or malformed inputs.

    Can you provide the constraints?

4.  Based on the information and the example inputs you've provided, here's a Python test suite to validate the functionality of calculating the point value of scratchcards. This suite includes tests for various scenarios, such as multiple matches, no matches, and different numbers of numbers in winning numbers and the user's numbers.

    First, let's define the function signature we are testing:

    ```python
    def calculate_scratchcard_points(input_str: str) -> int:
        """
        Calculate the total points from a set of scratchcards.

        :param input_str: A multiline string where each line represents a scratchcard in the format "winning numbers | user's numbers".
        :return: Total point value of all scratchcards.
        """
        pass  # This is where the implementation will go
    ```

    Now, the test cases based on the provided examples and additional scenarios:

    ```python
    import unittest
    from scratchcard_calculator import calculate_scratchcard_points

    class TestScratchcardCalculator(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_multiple_matches(self):
            input_str = "41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86  6 31 17  9 48 53"
            self.assertEqual(calculate_scratchcard_points(input_str), 8, "Should calculate points correctly for multiple matches")

        def test_two_matches(self):
            input_str = "13 32 20 16 61 | 61 30 68 82 17 32 24 19\n1 21 53 59 44 | 69 82 63 72 16 21 14  1"
            self.assertEqual(calculate_scratchcard_points(input_str), 4, "Should calculate points correctly for two matches across cards")

        def test_single_match(self):
            input_str = "41 92 73 84 69 | 59 84 76 51 58  5 54 83"
            self.assertEqual(calculate_scratchcard_points(input_str), 1, "Should calculate points correctly for a single match")

        def test_no_matches(self):
            input_str = "87 83 26 28 32 | 88 30 70 12 93 22 82 36\n31 18 13 56 72 | 74 77 10 23 35 67 36 11"
            self.assertEqual(calculate_scratchcard_points(input_str), 0, "Should calculate 0 points for no matches")

        def test_mixed_results(self):
            input_str = """41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86  6 31 17  9 48 53
    13 32 20 16 61 | 61 30 68 82 17 32 24 19
    1 21 53 59 44 | 69 82 63 72 16 21 14  1
    41 92 73 84 69 | 59 84 76 51 58  5 54 83
    87 83 26 28 32 | 88 30 70 12 93 22 82 36
    31 18 13 56 72 | 74 77 10 23 35 67 36 11"""
            self.assertEqual(calculate_scratchcard_points(input_str), 13, "Should calculate total points correctly for mixed results")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        unittest.main()
    ```

    This test suite checks the function's ability to handle various scenarios, including multiple matches, single matches, no matches, and a mix of these across multiple scratchcards. The `test_mixed_results` case combines all the examples you provided into one test to verify the function's total point calculation over multiple lines/cards.

5.  Given the additional detail that each card's input string includes a prefix (e.g., "Card 1:"), I'll adjust the test suite to account for parsing this format. The function will need to ignore these prefixes and focus on extracting the numbers for processing. Here's the revised version of the test suite:

    ```python
    import unittest
    from scratchcard_calculator import calculate_scratchcard_points

    class TestScratchcardCalculatorWithPrefix(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_multiple_matches_with_prefix(self):
            input_str = "Card 1: 41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86  6 31 17  9 48 53"
            self.assertEqual(calculate_scratchcard_points(input_str), 8, "Should calculate points correctly for multiple matches with card prefix")

        def test_mixed_results_with_prefixes(self):
            input_str = """Card 1: 41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86  6 31 17  9 48 53
    Card 2: 13 32 20 16 61 | 61 30 68 82 17 32 24 19
    Card 3: 1 21 53 59 44 | 69 82 63 72 16 21 14  1
    Card 4: 41 92 73 84 69 | 59 84 76 51 58  5 54 83
    Card 5: 87 83 26 28 32 | 88 30 70 12 93 22 82 36
    Card 6: 31 18 13 56 72 | 74 77 10 23 35 67 36 11"""
            self.assertEqual(calculate_scratchcard_points(input_str), 13, "Should calculate total points correctly for mixed results with card prefixes")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        unittest.main()
    ```

    This test suite specifically accounts for the input string format including "Card X:" before the numbers. The tests assume that the function `calculate_scratchcard_points` is capable of parsing these inputs correctly to compute the total points according to the previously discussed rules.

6.  This new rule introduces a recursive element to the scratchcard game, where matches not only have an immediate effect but can also lead to additional winnings based on subsequent cards. To summarize, the process is as follows:

    1.  For each card, determine the number of matches with the winning numbers.
    2.  For each match, "win" a copy of subsequent cards, up to the number of matches.
    3.  Evaluate each won card as if it were an original card, applying the same rules to win further cards.
    4.  This process continues until no new cards are won from the latest round of copies.
    5.  The goal could be to determine the total number of cards won or to list all the won cards, depending on the specific requirement.

    This mechanism adds complexity, especially with the need to manage the recursive winning of cards and avoiding infinite loops or excessive recursion, particularly with cards that might win copies of themselves or each other in a cycle.

    Before proceeding to write test cases for this, I'll need an example to clarify a few points, such as:

    - How to handle the sequence of winnings, especially if a card wins copies of itself.
    - What happens when the winning of additional cards extends beyond the end of the original list of cards.
    - Any specific requirements for the output format (e.g., just a count of additional cards won, a list of all card numbers won, etc.).

    Can you provide an example that illustrates these points?

7.  Given the complexity introduced by Part 2 of the problem, let's outline the requirements for a new Python function that can handle this recursive winning mechanism. This function will need to:

    1.  Parse each card to determine the number of matching numbers.
    2.  For each match on a card, generate copies of subsequent cards up to the number of matches.
    3.  Treat each won card as an original to potentially win more cards.
    4.  Stop the process when no new cards are won from the latest copies.
    5.  Calculate the total number of scratchcards, including originals and all copies won.

    This process is significantly more complex due to its recursive nature. The function will not only have to track the number of matches but also manage the generation and processing of card copies. It's crucial to carefully manage the recursion to ensure it terminates correctly without getting into an infinite loop or exceeding stack limits.

    Based on the example provided, here's a test suite for this functionality:

    ```python
    import unittest
    from scratchcard_recursion import calculate_total_scratchcards

    class TestScratchcardRecursion(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_original_and_copies(self):
            input_str = """Card 1: 41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86  6 31 17  9 48 53
    Card 2: 13 32 20 16 61 | 61 30 68 82 17 32 24 19
    Card 3: 1 21 53 59 44 | 69 82 63 72 16 21 14  1
    Card 4: 41 92 73 84 69 | 59 84 76 51 58  5 54 83
    Card 5: 87 83 26 28 32 | 88 30 70 12 93 22 82 36
    Card 6: 31 18 13 56 72 | 74 77 10 23 35 67 36 11"""
            self.assertEqual(calculate_total_scratchcards(input_str), 30, "Should calculate the total number of scratchcards including originals and all copies won correctly")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        unittest.main()
    ```

    For `calculate_total_scratchcards`, the implementation will need to carefully manage the recursive aspect and keep track of all cards won to sum up the total number of scratchcards correctly. The key challenge will be ensuring that the recursion is managed efficiently and accurately, especially in cases where multiple copies of the same card could potentially win additional copies of other cards.
