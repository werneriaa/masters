## Prompts

1.  Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if: Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

2.  Example 1: Input: s = "()" Output: true Example 2: Input: s = "()[]{}" Output: true Example 3: Input: s = "(]" Output: false

3.  Constraints: 1 <= s.length <= 104 s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.

## Answers

1.  For the given requirements, we need to test various scenarios to ensure the function correctly identifies valid and invalid strings based on the criteria provided. Here are some potential scenarios we might need to test:

    1.  A string with matched and correctly ordered parentheses.
    2.  A string with matched but incorrectly ordered parentheses.
    3.  A string with unmatched parentheses.
    4.  An empty string (which should technically be considered valid as there are no unmatched parentheses).
    5.  A string with nested valid parentheses of different types.
    6.  A string that starts with a closing parenthesis.
    7.  A string with all opening parentheses but no closing ones.
    8.  A string with mixed valid and invalid sequences of parentheses.

    Could you provide examples for each of these scenarios?

2.  Based on the examples provided, we'll create unit tests for the following cases:

    1.  **Test with matched and correctly ordered parentheses** - This tests a simple case where the string contains a single pair of parentheses. Example: `s = "()"` should return `true`.
    2.  **Test with multiple types of matched and correctly ordered brackets** - This tests a case where the string contains multiple types of brackets, all of which are correctly matched and ordered. Example: `s = "()[]{}"` should return `true`.
    3.  **Test with matched but incorrectly ordered brackets** - This tests a case where brackets are matched but not in the correct order. Example: `s = "(]"` should return `false`.

    Let's proceed with the constraints to ensure we cover all necessary scenarios comprehensively.

3.  Given the constraints and the example cases, we can now outline a series of unit tests to ensure our function behaves as expected across various scenarios. We'll include tests for strings of different lengths, including the minimum and maximum lengths specified by the constraints. Here's a draft of what our unit tests might look like:

    1.  **Test with a single pair of parentheses** - This will test the function with the smallest valid input, such as `"()"`.
    2.  **Test with multiple types of matched and correctly ordered brackets** - For example, `s = "()[]{}"` to verify the function can handle mixed types of brackets.
    3.  **Test with matched but incorrectly ordered brackets** - Such as `s = "(]"`, where the order violates the validity rules.
    4.  **Test with an empty string** - Since an empty string is technically valid, we should test to ensure the function returns `true` for `s = ""`.
    5.  **Test with nested valid parentheses of different types** - To check if the function correctly handles nested structures, e.g., `s = "({[]})"`.
    6.  **Test with a string that starts with a closing parenthesis** - This should return `false`, for example, `s = "]()"`.
    7.  **Test with all opening but no closing parentheses** - Such as `s = "(((("`, expecting `false`.
    8.  **Test with a very long valid string** - We should test the function with a string that approaches the maximum length constraint, ensuring it still returns the correct result.
    9.  **Test with a very long invalid string** - Similarly, a long string that is invalid should also be tested.

    Now, I'll generate the unit test code for these scenarios. Assuming the function we're testing is named `isValid`, here is how the unit tests could be structured:

    ```python
    import unittest
    from solution import isValid  # Assuming the function is in a file named solution.py

    class TestIsValidFunction(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_single_pair_of_parentheses(self):
            self.assertTrue(isValid("()"))

        def test_multiple_types_of_matched_brackets(self):
            self.assertTrue(isValid("()[]{}"))

        def test_matched_but_incorrectly_ordered_brackets(self):
            self.assertFalse(isValid("(]"))

        def test_empty_string(self):
            self.assertTrue(isValid(""))

        def test_nested_valid_parentheses_of_different_types(self):
            self.assertTrue(isValid("({[]})"))

        def test_string_starts_with_closing_parenthesis(self):
            self.assertFalse(isValid("]())"))

        def test_all_opening_no_closing_parentheses(self):
            self.assertFalse(isValid("(((("))

        def test_very_long_valid_string(self):
            self.assertTrue(isValid("()" * 5200))  # Generates a string with 10400 characters

        def test_very_long_invalid_string(self):
            self.assertFalse(isValid("((((" * 2600))  # Generates a string with 10400 characters

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        unittest.main()
    ```

    This setup covers a variety of cases, including the basic functionality, edge cases, and performance under stress (with very long strings).
